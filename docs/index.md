## Technical specifications

The solution was written in VBA and built in a Microsoft Office Add-in.

The performance acceptance criteria adopted in this project is the API 610 11th edition, Centrifugal pumps for petroleum, petrochemical and natural gas industries.

The computation of test parameters follows the ANSI/HI 14.6 Rotodynamic Pumps - Hydraulic Performance Acceptance Tests.

The computation of viscosity correction is accordingly the ANSI/HI 9.6 Rotodynamic Pumps -  Guideline for Effects of Liquid Viscosity on Performance.
